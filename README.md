# Entry for the gamejam MelonJam5 üçà

- Made in a 72 hour period
- International team
- Theme of the jam "Flow"
   - ` We made game around the concept of Flow in videogame design and tried to apply to a "simulation" of a DND master that needs to "modify the fate" of its players so they dont get frustrated while playing while offering, "gods blessings" to heal them, or a RNG(not rng) meteor that falls in the face of their enemies.`
- What is the game about?
  - `As a D&D master, you must create an intriguing game that challenges your players without causing them frustration from losing.`
